What is a blackboard if not to play with i100? 
Digital_Darwinism Group is proud to present its first game for iPhone and 
iPod touch. 
The aim is to fill all the boxes with numbers from 1 to 100 
consecutively. 

To place the numbers, that will be added simply by touching the 
csella want, you ought to respect two simple rules: 
1) To insert a number in horizontal or vertical, allow two 
empty boxes than the box is located in the last number; 
2) To insert a number diagonally you must leave one box 
empty. 

The button "Help" will help when we know what moves to do: 
touching will be highlighted boxes available, provided that there 
are, to continue the game. 

Where there noticing that he had made a wrong move, we 
back (to a maximum of three moves) tapping again 
box where we put the last number, so to move 
above. This will not be possible when it comes to a position 
which are no longer available legal moves, in which case the game 
ends. 

The button "Reset" will serve to start a new game, erasing 
all the numbers already placed.
